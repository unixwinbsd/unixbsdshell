Ruby is a programming language created 20 years ago by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto. Based on its popularity and usage, the Ruby programming language is ranked in the top ten. Ruby's popularity is supported by the Rails application which is already very well-known in creating static websites.

While Rails is a software library that extends the Ruby programming language. Rails creator David Heinemeier Hansson gave it the name "Ruby on Rails," although it is often simply called "Rails." Rails is software code added to the Ruby programming language. Technically, it is a package library (specifically, RubyGem), which is installed using a command-line interface on Unix or Linux operating systems.

Rails is a framework for building websites. As such, Rails establishes conventions for easier collaboration and maintenance. These conventions are codified as the Rails API (application programming interface, or directives that control code). The Rails API is documented online and explained in books, articles, and blog posts. Learning Rails means learning how to use Rails conventions and its API.

In this article we will explain the process of installing and configuring Rails on the OpenBSD 7.6 operating system.

## 1. How to Install Ruby on Rails on OpenBSD
To run Rail on OpenBSD, you must first enable Ruby by installing it. Below are the commands to install Ruby on OpenBSD.

```
ns3# pkg_add update
ns3# pkg_add upgrade
ns3# pkg_add ruby
```

After the Ruby installation process is complete, you continue by checking Ruby. This is to ensure whether Ruby has been installed or not on OpenBSD.

```
ns3# ruby -v
ruby 3.3.5 (2024-09-03 revision ef084cc8f4) [x86_64-openbsd]
ns3# bundler -v
Bundler version 2.6.6
```
