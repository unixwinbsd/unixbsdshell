In modern enterprise network architecture, it has a complex and complicated structure. Lots of devices are connected to each other simultaneously, making it convenient for offenders and anyone with illegal intentions. To overcome this problem, a mechanism for recording subject information in the network was developed. A RADIUS server that can provide 3 security functions: authentication, authorization and accounting. Every step in the system will be logged and all records and entry points will be monitored.

FreeRADIUS is an excellent free server and provides centralized authentication and authorization services for devices including switches, routers, VPN gateways, and Wi-Fi access points. Its unique ability to manage user access to network resources based on various parameters such as identity, location, device characteristics and time of day, makes it a versatile solution for enterprise, education and service provider networks.

The server supports multiple authentication methods and can integrate with external databases such as SQL, LDAP, and Kerberos to efficiently store and retrieve user and device information. With its scalability, flexibility and reliability, FreeRADIUS remains the top choice for organizations requiring a reliable and customizable RADIUS solution.
