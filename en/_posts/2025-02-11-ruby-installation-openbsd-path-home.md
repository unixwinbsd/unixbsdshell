Panduan Instal Ruby di OpenBSD - PATH $HOME Ruby

Ruby is one of the most widely used and easy to use programming languages. Ruby is an open-source object-oriented interpreter that can be installed on Linux systems. Many programmers prefer Python over Ruby to start learning basic programming, but Ruby can handle large web frameworks and web applications.

Once you start learning Ruby, you will find it less machine-like and less repetitive. If you are confused about the difference between Ruby and Ruby on Rails, I must mention that they are not the same. Ruby is an open-source, object-oriented, and general-purpose programming language that is one of the most popular programming languages.

Whereas Ruby on Rails is a web framework. There are several Ruby maintainers available to install Ruby. Ruby maintainers allow the use of multiple versions and help switch between Ruby versions. The most commonly used Ruby maintainers are rbenv and rvm. Ruby is also available in the OpenBSD repository.<br><br/>
