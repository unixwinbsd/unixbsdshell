An important part of managing server configuration and infrastructure involves maintaining and finding a way to find network interfaces and IP addresses by name website. One way to do this is to set up a Domain Name System (DNS). Use a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). Determining the domain name on a server will make configuration easier, make maintenance easier and improve application service performance.

Setting up private DNS for your private network is a great way to improve your server management and prevent hacker attacks.
