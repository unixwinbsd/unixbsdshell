  "description": "Unbound is a highly secure validating, recursive, and caching DNS server developed by NLnet Labs, VeriSign Inc, Nominet, and Kirei",
  "articleBody": "The DNS service or Domain Name System is a basic service of the Internet, as well as other networks that operate based on the TCP/IP protocol family, and is used to obtain matching host names on the network with corresponding digital addresses. Despite such a simple description, DNS is perhaps the most complex network service in terms of its structure and set of interactions, and its reliable operation depends on the reliable operation of everyone and everything.\n\nDNSSEC provides authentication of DNS records using digital signatures, which protects them from possible replacement. However, at the same time, all data is always transmitted in clear form and is not protected from view during transit in any way. In the absence of a digital signature, if desired, it can be easily modified for various purposes - from criminal to censorship.\n\nThis article explains how to configure and use the Unbound DNS server, both as caching, DNSSEC and as DNS over TLS.\n\nUnbound is a highly secure validating, recursive, and caching DNS server developed by NLnet Labs, VeriSign Inc, Nominet, and Kirei. This software is distributed free of charge under the BSD license. Binaries are written with a high security focus and very strict C code.\n\nTo help improve online privacy, Unbound supports DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS allowing clients to encrypt their communications. In addition, it supports various modern standards that limit the amount of data exchanged with official servers. This standard not only improves privacy but also helps make DNS more robust. The most important are Query Name Minimisation, Aggressive Use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache and support for authority zones, which can be used to load a copy of the root zone.\n\n\n1. System Specifications\n\n  OS: FreeBSD 13\n  Hostname: miner4\n  Domain: miner4pool.org\n  IP LAN Private: 192.168.9.3/24\n  Unbound Caching DNS Server: 192.168.9.3@53\n  Unbound Caching DNS over TLS: 192.168.9.3@853\n\n    2. Instalasi Unbound\n    Generally, to install Unbound on a FreeBSD server, you can do two things, namely ports and pkg. In this article, we will discuss installation with pkg.\n  \n\n\nThe first step, please log in to your FreeBSD server via the FreeBSD console or remote SSH with PuTTy, then run the following command lines:\n\nroot@miner4:~ # pkg update\nroot@miner4:~ # pkg upgrade\n\n\nAfter finishing updating the pkg package, we continue with installing unbound, type the following command to install unbound.\n\nroot@miner4:~ #  pkg install unbound bind-tools ca_root_nss\n\n\nSo that the unbound server can run automatically every time the FreeBSD server is turned off or restarted, you must first add the following command to rc.conf, by typing the script below in the /etc/rc.conf file.\n\nroot@miner4:~ # ee /etc/rc.conf\nunbound_enable=\"YES\"\nunbound_config=\"/usr/local/etc/unbound/unbound.conf\"\nunbound_pidfile=\"/usr/local/etc/unbound/unbound.pid\"\nunbound_anchorflags=\"\"\n\n\nAfter that, in the “resolv.conf” file, enter the script below. Use the default FreeBSD application, namely “ee” to add the script.\n\nroot@miner4:~ # ee /etc/resolv.conf\ndomain miner4pool.org\nnameserver 192.168.9.3\n\n\nEdit the hosts file, use the command ee /etc/hosts, then enter the following syntax.\n\nroot@miner4:~ # ee /etc/hosts\n127.0.0.1      localhost localhost.miner4pool.org\n192.168.9.3    miner4 miner4.miner4pool.org\n\n\n3. Unbound Configuration\nBefore we start configuring unbound.conf, the unbound application requires a “root.hints” file that lists the primary DNS Server. The Unbound DNS Server application comes with a list of root DNS Servers in its code, but it ensures an up-to-date copy on each server. A good practice is to update this file every six months.\n\nBy default the unbound.conf file is in the /usr/local/etc/unbound directory. In the Putty console, type the following command.\n\nroot@miner4:~ # wget ftp://FTP.INTERNIC.NET/domain/named.cache -O /usr/local/etc/unbound/root.hints\n\n\nAdditionally, Unbound requires an auto-trust-anchor file. This file contains the keys so that DNSSEC can be validated. To generate the root.key, run the following command in the putty console.\n\nroot@miner4:~ # cd /usr/local/etc/unbound\nroot@miner4:~ # unbound-anchor -a \"/usr/local/etc/unbound/root.key\"\n\n\nThe next step is to create the necessary keys for Unbound to be controlled by unbound-control, type the command below to run unbound control setup.\n\nroot@miner4:~ # cd /usr/local/etc/unbound\nroot@miner4:~ # unbound-control-setup\n\n\nAfter that create an Unbound log file.\n\nroot@miner4:~ # cd /usr/local/etc/unbound\nroot@miner4:~ # mkdir log &amp;&amp; touch /usr/local/etc/unbound/log/unbound.log\nroot@miner4:~ # chown unbound log\n\n\nThe next step is to edit the unbound.conf file, which is located at /usr/local/etc/unbound/unbound.conf\nBefore we edit the unbound.conf file, in this section we will divide it into 3 sessions, namely:\n\n  Unbound Server as DNS Caching\n  Server Unbound as DNS Caching and DNS Over TLS\n\n\nThis was deliberately created to make it easier for readers to understand and study the Unbound server.\n\na. Unbound Server as DNS Caching\nSo that unbound can function as DNS caching, we have to edit the unbound.conf file. Type the following command in the putty console.\n\nroot@miner4:~ # cd /usr/local/etc/unbound\nroot@miner4:~ # ee unbound.conf\n\n\nBelow is a complete example script from the “unbound.conf” file.\n\n#\n# Example configuration file.\n#\n# See unbound.conf(5) man page, version 1.17.1.\n#\n# this is a comment.\n\n# Use this anywhere in the file to include other text into this file.\n#include: \"otherfile.conf\"\n\n# Use this anywhere in the file to include other text, that explicitly starts a\n# clause, into this file.

Unbound Server as DNS Caching &amp; DNS Over TLS\nAnother more modern way to protect DNS traffic is the DNS-over-TLS protocol described in the RFC7858 standard, which is data encapsulation in standard TLS. We recommend using port 853 for access. Just like DNSCrypt, it is assumed that the DNS client, which is usually the same local caching DNS, accesses a remote server that supports DNS-over-TLS.\n\nThe aforementioned Unbound has built-in support for this protocol, so no additional software layer is required to use, as is the case with DNSCrypt.\n\nIn order for Unbound to run as DNS-over-TLS, Unbound only requires a list of servers in the forward zone, the same as the configuration file above, but there are a few things that need to be changed. Setting up Unbound as a server serving DNS-over-TLS requests is also easy. To do this, you can use an existing TLS certificate, for example openssl.\n\nThe first step that must be taken to implement unbound as a DNS Over TLS server is to create an SSL certificate. We will place this unbound SSL file in the /etc/ssl/unbound directory. To do this, in the Putty console menu, type the following command.\n\nroot@miner4:~ # cd /etc\nroot@miner4:~ # mkdir ssl\nroot@miner4:~ # mkdir /etc/ssl/unbound\nroot@miner4:~ # cd /etc/ssl/unbound\nroot@miner4:~ # openssl genrsa -des3 -out myCA.key 2048\nroot@miner4:~ # openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key myCA.key -sha256 -days 1825 -out myCA.pem\nroot@miner4:~ # openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout mydomain.key -out mydomain.csr\nroot@miner4:~ # openssl x509 -req -in mydomain.csr -CA myCA.pem -CAkey myCA.key -CAcreateserial -out mydomain.pem -days 1825 -sha256\n\n\nAfter we have successfully created the SSL file, the next step is to change the unbound.conf file above. Type the following command in the putty console.\n\nroot@miner4:~ # cd /usr/local/etc/unbound\nroot@miner4:~ # ee unbound.conf\n\n\nThe next step is to edit the unbound.conf file, as in the example below:\n\n#\n# Example configuration file.\n#\n# See unbound.conf(5) man page, version 1.17.1.\n#\n# this is a comment.\n\n# Use this anywhere in the file to include other text into this file.\n#include: \"otherfile.conf\"\n\n# Use this anywhere in the file to include other text, that explicitly starts a\n# clause, into this file.

Type the following command to view open DNS ports:\n\nroot@miner4:~ # sockstat -P udp -p 53,853\n\n\nFrom the open ports above, we can see that port 853 and port 53 are open. This indicates Server Unbound DNS Over TLS RUNNING.\n\n4. Create an Unbound Log File\nThe final step, we will create a log file. In the Putty console, type the command below and enter the script in the /etc/newsyslog.conf file.\n\nroot@miner4:~ # ee /etc/newsyslog.conf\n\n/usr/local/etc/unbound/log/unbound.log  unbound:wheel     640  7     *    @T12  JBR   /usr/local/etc/unbound/log_reopen\n\n\nThe next step, we create a log_reopen file and enter the following script in the log_reopen.\n\nroot@miner4:~ # ee /usr/local/etc/unbound/log_reopen\n\n#!/bin/sh\n/usr/local/sbin/unbound-control -q log_reopen\nexit 0\n\n\nThen restart unbound and system log files.\n\nroot@miner4:~ # service unbound restart\nroot@miner4:~ # service newsyslog restart\n\n\nDNS over TLS or DNS over TCP, but wrapped within a TLS session, will encrypt your requests and the server’s replies, and optionally allow you to verify the server’s identity.\n\nThe advantage is protection against eavesdropping and manipulation of your DNS traffic. the downside is a slight performance degradation and potential firewall traversal issues, as it runs over a non-standard port (TCP port 853) that may be blocked on some networks.\n\nThis tutorial has helped you in setting up and configuring Unbound DNS Over TLS. These tutorials are discussed in detail and structured, with the hope that you can easily understand them.\n",

</h1></header><section class="page__content" itemprop="text">
        <p>The DNS service or Domain Name System is a basic service of the Internet, as well as other networks that operate based on the TCP/IP protocol family, and is used to obtain matching host names on the network with corresponding digital addresses. Despite such a simple description, DNS is perhaps the most complex network service in terms of its structure and set of interactions, and its reliable operation depends on the reliable operation of everyone and everything.</p>

<p>DNSSEC provides authentication of DNS records using digital signatures, which protects them from possible replacement. However, at the same time, all data is always transmitted in clear form and is not protected from view during transit in any way. In the absence of a digital signature, if desired, it can be easily modified for various purposes - from criminal to censorship.</p>

<p>This article explains how to configure and use the Unbound DNS server, both as caching, DNSSEC and as DNS over TLS.</p>

<p>Unbound is a highly secure validating, recursive, and caching DNS server developed by NLnet Labs, VeriSign Inc, Nominet, and Kirei. This software is distributed free of charge under the BSD license. Binaries are written with a high security focus and very strict C code.</p>

<p>To help improve online privacy, Unbound supports DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS allowing clients to encrypt their communications. In addition, it supports various modern standards that limit the amount of data exchanged with official servers. This standard not only improves privacy but also helps make DNS more robust. The most important are Query Name Minimisation, Aggressive Use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache and support for authority zones, which can be used to load a copy of the root zone.

<br /><br />
    <h2 id="2-instalasi-unbound">2. Instalasi Unbound</h2>
    <p>Generally, to install Unbound on a FreeBSD server, you can do two things, namely ports and pkg. In this article, we will discuss installation with pkg.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The first step, please log in to your FreeBSD server via the FreeBSD console or remote SSH with PuTTy, then run the following command lines:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@miner4:~ # pkg update
root@miner4:~ # pkg upgrade
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After finishing updating the pkg package, we continue with installing unbound, type the following command to install unbound.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@miner4:~ #  pkg install unbound bind-tools ca_root_nss
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So that the unbound server can run automatically every time the FreeBSD server is turned off or restarted, you must first add the following command to rc.conf, by typing the script below in the /etc/rc.conf file.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@miner4:~ # ee /etc/rc.conf
unbound_enable="YES"
unbound_config="/usr/local/etc/unbound/unbound.conf"
unbound_pidfile="/usr/local/etc/unbound/unbound.pid"
unbound_anchorflags=""
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After that, in the “resolv.conf” file, enter the script below. Use the default FreeBSD application, namely “ee” to add the script.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@miner4:~ # ee /etc/resolv.conf
domain miner4pool.org
nameserver 192.168.9.3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Edit the hosts file, use the command ee /etc/hosts, then enter the following syntax.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@miner4:~ # ee /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1      localhost localhost.miner4pool.org
192.168.9.3    miner4 miner4.miner4pool.org
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<h2 id="3-unbound-configuration">3. Unbound Configuration</h2>
<p>Before we start configuring unbound.conf, the unbound application requires a “root.hints” file that lists the primary DNS Server. The Unbound DNS Server application comes with a list of root DNS Servers in its code, but it ensures an up-to-date copy on each server. A good practice is to update this file every six months.</p>

<p>By default the unbound.conf file is in the /usr/local/etc/unbound directory. In the Putty console, type the following command.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@miner4:~ # wget ftp://FTP.INTERNIC.NET/domain/named.cache -O /usr/local/etc/unbound/root.hints
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Additionally, Unbound requires an auto-trust-anchor file. This file contains the keys so that DNSSEC can be validated. To generate the root.key, run the following command in the putty console.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@miner4:~ # cd /usr/local/etc/unbound
root@miner4:~ # unbound-anchor -a "/usr/local/etc/unbound/root.key"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The next step is to create the necessary keys for Unbound to be controlled by unbound-control, type the command below to run unbound control setup.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@miner4:~ # cd /usr/local/etc/unbound
root@miner4:~ # unbound-control-setup
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After that create an Unbound log file.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@miner4:~ # cd /usr/local/etc/unbound
root@miner4:~ # mkdir log &amp;&amp; touch /usr/local/etc/unbound/log/unbound.log
root@miner4:~ # chown unbound log
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The next step is to edit the unbound.conf file, which is located at /usr/local/etc/unbound/unbound.conf
Before we edit the unbound.conf file, in this section we will divide it into 3 sessions, namely:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Unbound Server as DNS Caching</li>
  <li>Server Unbound as DNS Caching and DNS Over TLS</li>
</ol>

<p>This was deliberately created to make it easier for readers to understand and study the Unbound server.</p>

<h3 id="a-unbound-server-as-dns-caching">a. Unbound Server as DNS Caching</h3>
<p>So that unbound can function as DNS caching, we have to edit the unbound.conf file. Type the following command in the putty console.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@miner4:~ # cd /usr/local/etc/unbound
root@miner4:~ # ee unbound.conf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Below is a complete example script from the “unbound.conf” file.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#

<h3 id="b-unbound-server-as-dns-caching--dns-over-tls">b. Unbound Server as DNS Caching &amp; DNS Over TLS</h3>
<p>Another more modern way to protect DNS traffic is the DNS-over-TLS protocol described in the RFC7858 standard, which is data encapsulation in standard TLS. We recommend using port 853 for access. Just like DNSCrypt, it is assumed that the DNS client, which is usually the same local caching DNS, accesses a remote server that supports DNS-over-TLS.</p>

<p>The aforementioned Unbound has built-in support for this protocol, so no additional software layer is required to use, as is the case with DNSCrypt.</p>

<p>In order for Unbound to run as DNS-over-TLS, Unbound only requires a list of servers in the forward zone, the same as the configuration file above, but there are a few things that need to be changed. Setting up Unbound as a server serving DNS-over-TLS requests is also easy. To do this, you can use an existing TLS certificate, for example openssl.</p>

<p>The first step that must be taken to implement unbound as a DNS Over TLS server is to create an SSL certificate. We will place this unbound SSL file in the /etc/ssl/unbound directory. To do this, in the Putty console menu, type the following command.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@miner4:~ # cd /etc
root@miner4:~ # mkdir ssl
root@miner4:~ # mkdir /etc/ssl/unbound
root@miner4:~ # cd /etc/ssl/unbound
root@miner4:~ # openssl genrsa -des3 -out myCA.key 2048
root@miner4:~ # openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key myCA.key -sha256 -days 1825 -out myCA.pem
root@miner4:~ # openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout mydomain.key -out mydomain.csr
root@miner4:~ # openssl x509 -req -in mydomain.csr -CA myCA.pem -CAkey myCA.key -CAcreateserial -out mydomain.pem -days 1825 -sha256
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After we have successfully created the SSL file, the next step is to change the unbound.conf file above. Type the following command in the putty console.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@miner4:~ # cd /usr/local/etc/unbound
root@miner4:~ # ee unbound.conf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The next step is to edit the unbound.conf file, as in the example below:</p>

# DNSCrypt
# To enable, use --enable-dnscrypt to configure before compiling.
# Caveats:
# 1. the keys/certs cannot be produced by Unbound. You can use dnscrypt-wrapper
#   for this: https://github.com/cofyc/dnscrypt-wrapper/blob/master/README.md#usage
# 2. dnscrypt channel attaches to an interface. you MUST set interfaces to
#   listen on `dnscrypt-port` with the follo0wing snippet:
# server:
#     interface: 0.0.0.0@443
#     interface: ::0@443
#
# Finally, `dnscrypt` config has its own section.

<p>After the unbound.conf file editing process is complete, restart the unbound server with the command:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@miner4:~ # service unbound restart
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Test server DNS unbound.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@miner4:~ # dig google.com -p 853
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The answer is the server: 192.168.9.3#853, this means that unbound NDS Over TLS port 853 is active. Type the following command to view open DNS ports:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@miner4:~ # sockstat -P udp -p 53,853
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>From the open ports above, we can see that port 853 and port 53 are open. This indicates Server Unbound DNS Over TLS RUNNING.
<br /><br /></p>
<h2 id="4-create-an-unbound-log-file">4. Create an Unbound Log File</h2>
<p>The final step, we will create a log file. In the Putty console, type the command below and enter the script in the /etc/newsyslog.conf file.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@miner4:~ # ee /etc/newsyslog.conf

/usr/local/etc/unbound/log/unbound.log  unbound:wheel     640  7     *    @T12  JBR   /usr/local/etc/unbound/log_reopen
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The next step, we create a log_reopen file and enter the following script in the log_reopen.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@miner4:~ # ee /usr/local/etc/unbound/log_reopen

#!/bin/sh
/usr/local/sbin/unbound-control -q log_reopen
exit 0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then restart unbound and system log files.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@miner4:~ # service unbound restart
root@miner4:~ # service newsyslog restart
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>DNS over TLS or DNS over TCP, but wrapped within a TLS session, will encrypt your requests and the server’s replies, and optionally allow you to verify the server’s identity.</p>

<p>The advantage is protection against eavesdropping and manipulation of your DNS traffic. the downside is a slight performance degradation and potential firewall traversal issues, as it runs over a non-standard port (TCP port 853) that may be blocked on some networks.</p>

<p>This tutorial has helped you in setting up and configuring Unbound DNS Over TLS. These tutorials are discussed in detail and structured, with the hope that you can easily understand them.</p>
