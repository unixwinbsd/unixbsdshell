**COVID drastically changed the mode of work for office workers. And while this blog post focuses on the consequences and teh future of office work, the majority of the workforce out there never had a choice. Factory workers, truck drivers, doctors, nurses, the people working at your grocery store — they had to take all the risks to keep us office workers ultimately alive. Do not forget their sacrifices and the pressure they had to deal with.**

FTR. I was one of the first to return to the Red Hat office in Munich after COVID started. I simply cannot work from home for various, very personal reasons that are none of your business. I just want to point out that people are people. And while I fully support the freedom to work from home for anybody who wants that and whose job description allows for that, many other people prefer to or have to work from an office. And that is also totally fine. It's not a binary decision.

Forced RTO (Return To Office) is unacceptable, that is no discussion. But please also don't forget how privileged many of us are to be able to work from home. The factory workers, the people working in grocery stores, doctors, nurses, truck drivers — the majority of the workforce out there — never had this luxury. I have always kept that in mind. They made it possible for people like us to actually be able to work from home.

Our office managers kept our offices in working condition, flushed toilets daily to keep them from clogging or drying out, took care of inspections needed, maintenance etc. I have thanked them many times for being there when we all weren't. I would love to have more people in the office. To have more water cooler talks. But hey, I have to accept that things have changed. I can only hope we find a working solution to keep our culture alive, because right now I fear it isn't working well.

In closing. Don't get me wrong. I don't want to force anyone to return to the office. But I do want you to think about it in a more nuanced way. What opportunities does an office create? IMHO especially for new hires in any company, social coherence is needed. To build connections, networks, understanding. You won't be able to build that in empty offices. I have no simple solution to offer. Just thoughts that I share. Take them in whatever way you want :)
